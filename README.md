# Server Calculator

## Calculator

Having a user interface where 2 values can be imputed and a mathematical operation is chosen. When submitted, capture the inputs and place into an object. The object will then be sent to the server. There is also a button to clear the inputs. 

The server is able to comprehend addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Once the calculation from the server is complete send the information in an object back to the client to be displayed in the DOM.
